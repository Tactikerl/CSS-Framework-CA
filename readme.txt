# JS2 CA

# This is my unpolished CA for review. The work that remains is as follows:
  -Adding JSdocs for documentation
  -Refactoring code to be more efficient and neat.
  -Making it fully modular(will be done while refactoring)
  -SCSS/SASS/Bootstrap to make it look proper.
  
# I wish for constructive feedback on functionality and code structure.
